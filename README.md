deckOfCards Exercise Webapp

This is a basic webapp that allows people to do a "Deck of Cards" workout using their web browser.
It is written in javascript, html and css.
It basically takes a normal sized deck of cards, allows the user to shuffle it creating a shuffled 'instance', and then draw the 'top card' from the shuffled deck over and over until the deck is empty.
For those that haven't done this kind of workout before, you assign an exercise to each suit, and as you pull each card you do the amount of reps it says on the card for each suit dependent exercise.
It is up to the user to assign face card values, but they can be 10 or 11, 12, and 13. Jokers can be other face cards or wildcards associated to unique exercises for a large amount of reps.
